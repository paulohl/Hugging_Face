# Setting Up the Environment and Installation Before starting the model training, 
# it's crucial to set up a conducive development environment. Here's how you can get started:
# 	1. Installation of Dependencies: Begin by installing Python and necessary libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, along with the Hugging Face Transformers library. This ensures compatibility and performance optimization with your hardware.
# bash
#
# pip install transformers torch torchvision
# 2. Virtual Environment Management: It's good practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies. This can be done using tools like Anaconda or virtualenv.
#
# bash
#
# python -m venv hf-env
# source hf-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `hf-env\Scripts\activate`
#
# Loading and Preparing Datasets Proper dataset preparation is crucial for effective model training:
#	1. Dataset Selection: Choose datasets that are relevant to your specific NLP task. For sentiment analysis, you might use the IMDb dataset, while for named entity recognition, the CoNLL-2003 dataset is appropriate.
#	2. Data Preprocessing: Tokenize and encode your data to fit the model's expected input format. Hereâ€™s a brief snippet demonstrating this with Hugging Face:

from transformers import BertTokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
encoded_input = tokenizer("Hello, this is an example.", return_tensors='pt')

# Training Models from Scratch Hereâ€™s how to configure and train your model from scratch:
#	1. Model Configuration: Set the configuration parameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size.

from transformers import TrainingArguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    num_train_epochs=3,              # number of training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,  # batch size for training
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,   # batch size for evaluation
    warmup_steps=500,                # number of warmup steps for learning rate scheduler
    weight_decay=0.01,               # strength of weight decay
    logging_dir='./logs',            # directory for storing logs
)

# 2. Model Initialization and Training: Initialize the model and start the training process.

from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                         # the instantiated ðŸ¤— Transformers model to be trained
    args=training_args,                  # training arguments, defined above
    train_dataset=train_dataset,         # training dataset
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset            # evaluation dataset
)
trainer.train()
