# Step-by-Step Guide to Fine-Tuning
#	1. Task Definition and Data Preparation: Clearly define your NLP task and prepare your dataset accordingly. If the task is sentiment analysis, ensure your data is labeled with sentiments.
#	2. Model Selection and Configuration: Select a suitable pre-trained model and adjust its configuration.

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)

# 3. Fine-Tuning Procedure: Conduct the fine-tuning process, adjusting hyperparameters and monitoring training metrics.
