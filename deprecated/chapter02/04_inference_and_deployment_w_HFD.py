# Performing Inference
#	1. Model Loading: Load your trained model for inference.
#	2. Prediction Generation: Use the model to make predictions.

predictions = trainer.predict(test_dataset)

# Techniques for Deploying Models in Production
#	• API Integration: Utilize frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to create APIs for model deployment.
#	• Containerization: Use Docker for deploying your models, ensuring they are easily scalable and maintainable.
