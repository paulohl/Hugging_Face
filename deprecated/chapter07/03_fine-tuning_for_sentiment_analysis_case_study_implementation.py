# Fine-tuning for Sentiment Analysis: Case Study and Implementation
#
# Case Study: Sentiment analysis is a critical tool for gauging public opinion on products, 
# services, and various issues. For instance, a company may use sentiment analysis to monitor 
# and analyze customer feedback on social media to enhance their products or services.
#
# Implementation Details:
#	• Model Selection: Selecting an appropriate model such as BERT or RoBERTa, which are robust in capturing contextual nuances of language.
#	• Data Preparation: Compiling datasets that may include product reviews, tweets, or comments with labeled sentiments.
# Fine-Tuning: Adapting the model to the specifics of sentiment classification, which involves adjusting layers specifically responsive to emotional expressions and tonal subtleties.
